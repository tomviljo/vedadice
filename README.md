# Veda Dice

Source code for the site [vedadice.com](https://vedadice.com) which links to random verses in holy books in the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition.

The site consists of static HTML pages which are generated with `generate.py`, which compresses the destination URLs for each book using run-length encoding.

Each page contains Javascript which uncompresses the URLs and redirects to a random URL.

### Thanks to
